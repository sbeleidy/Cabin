      <h2>Learning Everything is Not Easy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 columns medium-8">
      <p>Deciding that it is time to build out the idea in your head or start a career as a web person sounds great until you get started. That is when you realize there are a million things you do not know.</p>
      <p>It can be frustrating because everywhere you go to look for help pulls you into a different direction. Developers are supposed to learn design and designers are supposed to learn development. Both are supposed to know how to work in the command line and deploy changes to the server.</p>
      <p>You can pick up all of these things across a ton of different resources, but it can be hard putting all of the pieces together.</p>
      <p>The Full Stack Web School will show you how all of the pieces come together along with how to make them work.</p>
      <p>When you are done with the courses you will have a complete understanding of what it takes to get an online marketplace out the door. With this knowledge you can go on to design and build anything your mind can come up with.</p>

      <p>The school opened up in August with videos being released every week day.</p>
      <p>Besides courses focusing on specific technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.), we are also building 3 separate projects that will show the complete developer&rsquo;s workflow.</p>
      <h3>What Are We Building?</h3>
      <p>A Blog<br>Everyone needs a blog. This is a good starter project that will expose you to a number of different technologies.</p>
      <p>A Productivity App<br>The next project you will dive into will be a great todo list application.</p>
      <p>A Digital Marketplace<br>sA new digital online marketplace where anyone can sell their digital wares. This marketplace will handle payments, asset hosting, customer marketing, and more.</p>
      <p>This will not be a fake marketplace used just for teaching, but an actual one that I will build a business around. This is an extensive 3 month project.</p>
      <!--
      <p>Below is the timeline for the digital marketplace.</p>
      <p><strong>August</strong>: Designing the app, customer feedback, and iteration. We will design both the website and the web app, and get customer feedback along the way to iterate and be sure we have what we need for launch.</p>
      <p>You will learn best design practices and theories, Sketch, how to get user feedback you can use, and how to put it all together to create a design that achieves your goals.</p>
      <p><strong>September</strong>: Designing the backend and developing the beta. We will architect the app and understand what will be needed to make it a reality. Along the way we will develop a beta version using PHP/Laravel, MySQL, and other technologies.</p>
      <p><strong>October</strong>: Preparing for launch. Adding version 1 features, getting the proper server infrastructure in place, and setting up a marketplace payment system.</p>
      <p><strong>November</strong>: Public launch and celebration.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="small-12 columns medium-6">
      <p><strong>How much time do I need to commit to this?</strong><br>That is completely up to you. All of the courses are recorded videos posted online that you can view whenever you want. You set your own pace and learn when you make the time.</p>
      <p><strong>Is there any type of community involved?</strong><br>Yes, there is a Slack group open to all students which is extremely active. I am always around to help out (ask anyone).</p>
      <p><strong>How are the courses structured?</strong><br>The courses break down individual technologies that you can view (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Git, SQL, Development Tools, etc) that you can choose to go through or skip. Each project is broken down into its own course. This way, people of all skill levels can choose how they wish to go through the material.</p>
      <p><strong>Is it too late to sign up?</strong><br>It's never too late! Once all of the projects are done being built the Full Stack Web School will remain open. Start learning today!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
      <p><strong>Will this school work for Windows?</strong><br>Yes. The only Mac-only app that is used in the course is Sketch 3, but any graphics application (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc) can be used to follow along. If you don't want to touch any graphics applications then that is fine as well.</p>
      <p><strong>What software will I need to purchase?</strong><br>To follow along? None. I do use Sketch for some minor graphics work, but again you can use whatever graphics app you want. Everything else we use is easily downloaded of the Internet for free.</p>
      <p><strong>What skill level is required to get started with this school?</strong><br>You will have to know how to turn a computer and connect to the Internet. Beyond that the Full Stack Web School covers all skill levels.</p>
